# Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom sector using a dataset with various features such as customer usage patterns, service complaints, and demographic information. By addressing imbalanced data and incorporating feature engineering, the goal is to develop a robust model for identifying potential churners.

## Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is crucial for telecom companies to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. This project involves:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Applying techniques to manage class imbalance in the dataset.
- **Model Development**: Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict churn.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating interaction features, aggregating usage statistics, and using domain knowledge to derive new features.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Using techniques like SMOTE, undersampling, and class weighting to address the imbalance.
- **Modeling and Evaluation**: Training various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting) and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CustomerChurnPrediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CustomerChurnPrediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ApnaGuideChurnPrediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, engineer features, handle imbalanced data, and develop the prediction models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information on customer usage, service complaints, demographic details, and churn status. [Include a link to the dataset or instructions on how to obtain it, if applicable.]

## Results

The results of this project include a trained model capable of predicting customer churn with high accuracy. Detailed analysis and visualizations of the data and model performance are available in the Jupyter Notebook.
